# TLS Cipher Auditor

A Python script that analyzes SSL/TLS ciphers using nmap's ssl-enum-ciphers script and provides a color-coded output of safe and unsafe ciphers.

## Disclaimer

**Important Notice**: The cipher classifications (safe/unsafe) in this tool are recommendations based on general security best practices and are not an industry standard. The security requirements for your specific use case may vary. Always:
- Consult your organization's security policies
- Follow relevant compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA)
- Consider the specific needs of your application
- Consult with security professionals for production environments

## Description

This script automates the process of checking SSL/TLS ciphers on a target domain or IP address. It uses nmap's ssl-enum-ciphers script to enumerate supported ciphers and categorizes them as safe or unsafe based on modern security standards. The results are displayed with color coding for better visibility:
- ðŸŸ¢ Safe ciphers are shown in green
- ðŸ”´ Unsafe ciphers are shown in red

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- nmap installed and accessible from PATH

## Installation

1. Ensure nmap is installed on your system:
   ```bash
   # For Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install nmap

   # For CentOS/RHEL
   sudo yum install nmap

   # For macOS
   brew install nmap
   ```

2. Download the script:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Direct download
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Prim1Tive/TlsCipherAuditor/main/TlsCipherAuditor.py
   
   # Option 2: Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/Prim1Tive/TlsCipherAuditor.git
   cd TlsCipherAuditor
   ```

3. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x TlsCipherAuditor.py
   ```

## Usage

You can run the script in two ways:

1. With a command-line argument:
   ```bash
   python TlsCipherAuditor.py example.com
   ```

2. Interactive mode:
   ```bash
   python TlsCipherAuditor.py
   # You will be prompted to enter a domain or IP
   ```

## Safe Ciphers

The script considers the following ciphers as safe:
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
- TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
- TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

### Customizing Safe Ciphers

You can customize which ciphers are considered "safe" by modifying the `safe_ciphers` set in the script. This allows you to:
- Add your organization's approved ciphers
- Remove ciphers that don't meet your security requirements
- Match your specific compliance needs

To customize the list:
1. Open `TlsCipherAuditor.py` in a text editor
2. Locate the `safe_ciphers` set in the `check_ciphers()` function
3. Modify the list according to your requirements
```python
safe_ciphers = {
    "YOUR_APPROVED_CIPHER_1",
    "YOUR_APPROVED_CIPHER_2",
    # Add or remove ciphers as needed
}
```
